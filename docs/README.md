# DAOstack Arc.js Documentation Repository

**Attention**: Viewing documentation directly in the Arc.js GitHub repository is not supported as a means of obtaining Arc.js documentation online; you will find that not all of the links work and some of the styling doesn't appear the way it is supposed to.

Much better is the [official Arc.js documentation site](https://daostack.github.io/arc.js).
